# visitorTracking
## A simple PHP class to gather visitor information, and store it in a database using MYSQLi


### What makes this script special?
- It's more modern and complete than others I have seen around on Google/HotScripts. (SQLi, oop(ish?), etc...)
- No bells or whistles, fully customiziable.


## INSTALLATION
1. Upload the files to your server.

1. Edit the database configuration ( `/includes/db.php` )

1. Create the `visitors` table in your database. (`/_installation/visitors.sql` )

1. Instance the class in your code.

## EXAMPLE INITIALIZATION:
```php
//define database
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );           // set database host
define( 'DB_USER', 'root' );                // set database user
define( 'DB_PASS', '' );                    // set database password
define( 'DB_NAME', 'yourdatabasename' );    // set database name

//include the class
include( 'class.visitorTracking.php' );

//instance the class
$visitors = new visitorTracking();
```
The constructor method automatically calls the tracking method `$visitors->track();` which inserts the collected data.

You print the array containting the current visit by echoing `$visitors->displayThisVisit();`

You can output a table containing all the pagniated data from the database by echoing `$visitors->displayVisitors();`

Alternatively, you can just grab the table data from your database `SELECT * FROM visitors ORDER BY date DESC` and format it according to your specifications.
