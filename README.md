# visitorTracking
## A simple PHP class to gather visitor information, and store it in a database using MYSQLi


### What makes this script special? 
- It's more modern and complete than others I have seen around on Google/HotScripts. (SQLi, oop(ish?), etc...)
- Self-contained class, No API keys to get, no files to include,  no need for a bunch of pages.
- No bells or whistles, fully customiziable.

## INSTALLATION
1. Upload the files to your server. 

1. Edit the database configuration ( `/includes/db.php` ) 

1. Create the `visitors` table in your database. (`/_installation/visitors.sql` )

1. Instance the class in your code.

## EXAMPLE INITIALIZATION:
```php
//define database
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );			    // set database host
define( 'DB_USER', 'root' ); 				      // set database user
define( 'DB_PASS', 'root' ); 				      // set database password
define( 'DB_NAME', 'yourdatabasename' );	// set database name

//include the class
include( 'class.visitorTracking.php' );

//instance the class
$visitors = new visitorTracking();
```
The constructor method automatically calls the tracking method `$visitors->track();` which inserts the collected data.

You print the array containting the current visit by echoing `$visitors->displayThisVisit();`

You can output a table containing all the pagniated data from the database by echoing `$visitors->displayVisitors();`
